# Scotland Yard in Ruby

This is a command-line model of the board game Scotland Yard written in Ruby. I aimed for the code to be as simple as possible. For now the virtual players can play a random game. I'm hoping to add artificial intelligence and an interactive mode soon.

## Usage

To start the program go to the top level folder of the program and use

	ruby -I lib lib/controller.rb

Then watch the virtual Mr. X and the virtual agents play a game where everyone just plays randomly.
